<h3 name='class'>Class</h3>

- Blueprint or Template that Describes Attributes (Physical Properties) and Method(Behavior) of a Object.

<h3 name='obj'>Object</h3> 
- Instance of Class which has Property and Method

e.g. 
- Person is a Class 
- Supriya is an Instance of Class Person
- Property : Supriya has some Attributes (Height, Weight, Color, Gender)    
- Method : Behavior and Actions of Supriya (Talk, Run, Cook, Fight, Code)

<h3 name='abs'>Abstraction</h3>
- Show only Important Information and Hide the Unnecessary Background Information.
- Main Purpose is to Hide the Unnecessary Details from Users.
- Help to Reduce Program Complexity.

<h3 name='enc'>Encapsulation</h3> 
- Bind together the Data and Function (Class = Properties + Method)
- Class : Car
- Properties : (Physical Attributes of Car | Color, Type, Size, Name, Model)
- Method : (Action Performed by the Car | Use of Car | Drive | Stop)

<h3 name='poly'>Polymorphism (Many Forms)</h3>
- Having more than one form.
- e.g A Person at same time can have different Characteristics
(Like a Man at same time is a Father, a Husband, an Employee and Different Behaviour at Different Situation)

### Similar Words

> Parent Class | Base Class    | Super Class
 
> Child Class  | Derived Class | Sub Class

<h3 name='inh'>Inheritance</h3> 
- The Process in which one class acquire the Property and Method of another Class.
- e,g Child Inherit from Mom and Dad

### 1. Single Inheritance 
- Class B Inherit from Class A | New Class is Derived from Base Class
e.g. Boy Inherit from Father

### 2. Multilevel
- Class C Inherit from Class B and Class B Inherit from Class A
e.g. Boy Inherit from Father and Father Inherit from Grand Father.

### 3. Multiple  
- Class A Inherit from Class B and Class C | A Class can be Derived from more than One Base Class
e.g. Class Truck, Class Car, Class Bus Inherit from Class Vehicle.

### Method Overriding
- New Derived Class can inherit and Override the Methods of its Base Class.

### Method Overloading 
- Creating Multiple Methods with same name but with different (unique) Parameters.

### Operator Overloading
- Same Operator Behaves differently with Different Data Types according to Context.
- (+ Operator) performs Arithmetic Operations between Two Numbers and Concatenate Two Strings.

### Programming Constructs
- Common Building Blocks to Construct any Program

1. Sequence : Step by Step Process (Follow only One Direction)
2. Selection : Steps taken based on Conditions (If Else or True False Condition)
3. Iterations : Repeated Process which can Change the Step based on Certain Condition.

### String (https://www.w3schools.com/cs/cs_strings.asp)
- Sequence or Collection of Characters

### Numbers 
- Integers, Floating Point Numbers, Complex Number, Binary or Hexadecimal Numbers

### Booleans (https://www.w3schools.com/cs/cs_booleans.asp)
- Only True(1) and False(0), Mostly used with Loops and Conditions.

### Array (https://www.w3schools.com/cs/cs_arrays.asp)
- Store Multiple Values in a Single Variable 

string[] cars = {"I20", "Swift", "Creta", "Verna"}
