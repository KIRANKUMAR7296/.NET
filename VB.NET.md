# `VB.NET`

- `Visual Basic.NET` is an `object oriented programming` language implemented on the `.NET` Framework.
- Everything in `VB.NET` is an `object`
- All objects inherits from the base class `Object`

### `Class`

- `Blueprint` that describes `Attributes` and `Behaviours` of a `Class`

### `Object`

- `Instance` of a `Class`
- Objects have `attributes` | `properties` and `behaviors` | `actions` | `methods`
- e.g. Dog ( Attributes : Name, Breed, Color, Weight, Height ) and ( Actions : Barking, Running, Eating )

### `Method`

- Method is basically a `behaviour` | `action` of an object.
- `Functions` defined inside a `Class` is called `Methods`

### `Instance Attribute`

- Each object has its `unique` set of instance attribute.
- An object is created by `assigning` values to the attributes.

```csharp
s1 = Student(name="Kiran", age=25)
s2 = Student(name="Kumar", age=26)

Here üëÜüèª
name and age are instant attributes and have unique value for each instance s1 and s2
```

### `Identifiers`

- An `identifier` is a name used to identify a class, function, variable or any other user defined thing.
- It should not be a `reserved keyword`
